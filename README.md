# Course_Management_System

ðŸš€ *Excited to share my Course Management System project!* ðŸ“šðŸ’»  

I developed this project to simplify course management, enabling efficient handling of courses, students, and instructors. It has been a great learning experience, helping me strengthen my backend development skills!  

ðŸ”§ *Technologies & Techniques Used:*  
âœ… *PHP* for backend development  
âœ… *MySQL* for database management  
âœ… *HTML, CSS, JavaScript* for the frontend  
âœ… *CRUD Operations* for managing data efficiently  
âœ… *User Authentication & Authorization* for secure access  
âœ… *Form Validation* to enhance data integrity  
âœ… *Session Management* for tracking user interactions  
âœ… *PHPMailer* to send emails efficiently  

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge by learning *MVC (Model-View-Controller)* architecture to build more structured and scalable applications. Excited to keep growing! ðŸš€
